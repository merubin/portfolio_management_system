# Portfolio Management System  - GA WDI-12 Project 2 By Mike Rubin

The Portfolio Management System project is a full-stack application project  This program will  allow users to create a GA portfolio from the various projects they have completed.   During the course of a studentâ€™s WDI program they will create both projects and their portfolios.  This program will gather this information into a data model consisting of Users, Projects and Portfolios and allow a student to create a portfolio to show various projects. Portfolios can be created either from an individuals work or groups of individuals. This will allow work done to be created and shown in various ways allowing portfolios created by category that may fit the requirements of a specific job or employer.

## Approach Taken

This full-stack application was begun with the end in mind. I reviewed my current portfolio which I have hosted at mike-rubin.com and determined what data model I could represent it by. I built an initial ERD using draw.io and then began to map out the various screens I would need to show the functionality and screen design. The applications features a menu that allows easy access to the various projects or portfolio screens there you can edit and add additional 


## Future Features

Currently this application needs work with CSS styling.  A future enhancment would allow for each portfolio to include its own styling pages which would allow for a different style for each portfolio.
